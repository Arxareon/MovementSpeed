### Features
- See your own movement speed (in percentage and/or yards per second) within a customizable and repositionable text display.
- View the movement speed of other players or NPCs as well integrated into the inspect tooltip that appears when mousing over them.
- Set up Movement Speed via the Interface Options or the **/movespeed** chat command *(some settings are not available as chat commands)*.
- Includes multi-version support for Retail, Classic and Burning Crusade Classic!
